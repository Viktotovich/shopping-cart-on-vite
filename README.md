# Shopping cart on vite

This project was supposed to test React Router usability with a real-life use case.

Styles and general purchase logic was not part of the goal, and thus - there is no purchase button (for obvious reasons)

For testing, I had long thought about what to test - and haven't got a slightest clue - however, I do plan to implement tests on further projects,
specially after learning Express.
